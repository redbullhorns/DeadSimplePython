"""
This script demonstrates the use of various augmented assignment operators in Python.

1. foo = 10: This line initializes the variable `foo` with the value 10.
2. foo += 10: This line adds 10 to the current value of `foo` (10), resulting in 20.
3. foo -= 5: This line subtracts 5 from the current value of `foo` (20), resulting in 15.
4. foo *= 16: This line multiplies the current value of `foo` (15) by 16, resulting in 240.
5. foo //= 5: This line performs integer division of the current value of `foo` (240) by 5, resulting in 48.
6. foo /= 4: This line divides the current value of `foo` (48) by 4, resulting in 12.0.
7. foo **= 2: This line raises the current value of `foo` (12.0) to the power of 2, resulting in 144.0.
8. foo %= 51: This line calculates the modulus of the current value of `foo` (144.0) by 51, resulting in 42.0.
